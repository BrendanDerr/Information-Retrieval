Readme File by Brendan Derr
The main program is the assg1. java file
This program first initializes the citeseer folder into a file
It then creates a file to hold the stopwords from the stopwords file and stores those words into a hashtable
A file array is then made to hold all the files contained in the citeseer folder
Next each file from citeseer is read and preprocessed, with each unique word stored into a hashtable
Next the program prints the answers for task 2 of the assignment.
The program then does the same thing to the file array except this time it incorporates the porter.java file and removes all stop words from the hashtable.
For the porter-stemmer incorporation part, I lowercased all the words prior to stemming them because the stopwords file has all stopwords lowercased.
It then prints the answers for task 3 of the assignment.
